# openagents.com Agent Instructions (Rust-Only Active Lane)

Active implementation and serving paths:
- `apps/openagents.com/service/` (Rust control/API service)
- `apps/openagents.com/Dockerfile` (Rust-only image build)

Legacy Laravel/Inertia/TypeScript application files under `apps/openagents.com/app/`, `bootstrap/`, `config/`, `database/`, `resources/`, `routes/`, and `tests/` are archival reference only and must not be treated as active runtime authority.

If you need the historical Laravel-centric agent guidance, see:
