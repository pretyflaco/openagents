# Sync Docs

Khala sync documentation and runbooks:
- `ROADMAP.md`: migration and implementation sequencing
- `RUNTIME_CODEX_CUTOVER_RUNBOOK.md`: rollout/cutover procedure
- canonical contracts and invariants live in `docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/protocol/OA_SYNC_WS_MAPPING.md`

Historical sync snapshots and superseded notes are archived in backroom and are not canonical current-surface guidance.
