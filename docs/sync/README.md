# Sync Docs

Current-state Khala sync documentation and runbooks (legacy lane during replacement program):
- `ROADMAP.md`: migration and implementation sequencing
- `RUNTIME_CODEX_CUTOVER_RUNBOOK.md`: rollout/cutover procedure
- `SPACETIME_CUTOVER_ACCEPTANCE_AND_ROLLBACK.md`: go/no-go gates, rollback triggers, and promotion evidence checklist
- canonical contracts and invariants live in `docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/protocol/OA_SYNC_WS_MAPPING.md`

Spacetime replacement authority plans:
- `docs/plans/spacetimedb-full-integration.md`
- `docs/plans/2026-02-25-spacetimedb-autopilot-primary-comms-integration-plan.md`

Historical sync snapshots and superseded notes are archived in backroom and are not canonical current-surface guidance.
