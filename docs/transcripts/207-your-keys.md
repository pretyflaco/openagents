So that's the coding agent architecture. Now, how will users and agents communicate and pay each other to build this into a network? Well, through public key cryptography.

This is explained on our new doc site under Identity & Wallet on the left. There are a few keys you can see here. These are the relevant keys. These will be generated in the Autopilot desktop app. There will be a key pair generated automatically for you when you open the app for the first time, and you can regenerate them like this very easily.

And let's tell you what these are. So we've got the Nostr public key, Nostr secret key, Spark public key, and seed phrase.

The most relevant thing here to remember and write down is the seed phrase. This will be stored in a secure place on your computer, but you'll be able to see that and write this down. With this seed phrase, we can derive your Spark public key and your Nostr public key.

So Nostr, think identity. Think you've got a decentralized data network, free and global market of relays that you have access to, and that key pair will attach any identity data you want to it. You can connect a social account, you can be anonymous—it doesn't matter. You can put up an avatar. That all goes to your Nostr key pair.

And then Spark is a Bitcoin Layer 2 from a great company called Lightspark. And it's just a way of reliably transferring Bitcoin instantly and essentially freely anywhere in the world, built on top of the Lightning Network. So if there is a Spark public key, that you know someone else's Spark public key, you can just send them money instantly.

The Nostr secret key, this is derived from the seed phrase. It's used for signing messages; you don't really need to remember that.

The seed phrase is what you'll need to write down. This is a thing that you'll never want to share. You got to keep this safe. Note also that this is what we call a hot wallet setup. This is not set up for you to store large amounts of Bitcoin. Relate to this like a hot wallet. So ideally you can load a few dollars of Bitcoin here, or ideally you're not loading anything and you're just earning. But when you earn 10 dollars, 50 dollars, 100 dollars, more than you'll want to spend on compute or agents or whatever, you'll want to sweep that out to a more secure wallet. Which we will not be running, but you'll use something like, well, any of the great wallets that are out there.

Okay. This is documented on our website, our doc site. And let's keep it simple people. There's a lot of kind of bullshit out there in crypto land and we're going to make it real easy for you to transact and do stuff in Autopilot. And wanted you to have a little crash course on that before we begin. See ya.
