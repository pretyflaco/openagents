# Autopilot Docs

- Autopilot is the flagship product: a cross-platform coding agent that turns repo issues into verified PRs, within a budget, with receipts + replay artifacts.
- Desktop is the execution surface; web and iOS are control/history/monitor surfaces (capabilities differ by surface).
- Desktop may optionally run OpenAgents Compute provider mode (Pylon) to contribute compute and earn credits (default off).
